%WPCMPSCR Wavelet packets 1-D or 2-D compression scores.
%   [THR,RL2,NZ,IMIN,STHR] = WPCMPSCR(TREE) returns
%   for the input wavelet packets tree TREE compression scores
%   and suggested threshold when approximation is kept:
%   THR the vector of ordered thresholds.
%   and the corresponding vectors of scores induced by
%   a THR(i)-thresholding :
%   RL2 vector of 2-norm recovery score in percent.
%   NZ  vector of relative number of zeros in percent.
%   IMIN is the index of THR for which the two scores are
%   approximately the same.
%   STHR is a suggested threshold.
%
%   When used with two arguments WPCMPSCR(TREE,IN2) 
%   returns the same outputs but all coefficients can be 
%   thresholded.
