%UPWLEV2 Single-level reconstruction of 2-D wavelet decomposition.
%   [NC,NS,CA] = UPWLEV2(C,S,'wname') performs the single-level
%   reconstruction of wavelet decomposition structure 
%   [C,S] giving the new one [NC,NS], and extracts the last
%   approximation coefficients matrix CA.
%
%   [C,S] is a decomposition at level n = size(S,1)-2, so
%   [NC,NS] is the same decomposition at level n-1 and CA 
%   is the approximation matrix at level n.
%
%   'wname' is a string containing the wavelet name,
%   C is the original wavelet decomposition vector and
%   S the corresponding bookkeeping matrix (for 
%   detailed storage information, see WAVEDEC2).
%
%   Instead of giving the wavelet name, you can give the
%   filters.
%   For [NC,NS,CA] = UPWLEV2(C,S,Lo_R,Hi_R),
%   Lo_R is the reconstruction low-pass filter and
%   Hi_R is the reconstruction high-pass filter.
%
%   NOTE: If C and S are obtained from an indexed image analysis
%   (respectiveley a truecolor image analysis) then CA is an
%   m-by-n matrix (respectiveley an m-by-n-by-3 array).
%   So the sizes of the vector NC and the matrix NS depend on
%   the analyzed image format.
%   For more information on image formats, see the reference
%   pages of IMAGE and IMFINFO functions.
